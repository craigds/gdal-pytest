    "Automated: Rename all python tests to test_*\n\nPytest learns what tests are by what it's called.\nThis change was generated by looking at `gdaltest_list` in autotest/ modules,\nand renaming all mentioned tests if they weren't already called `test_*`\n",
    "Automated: Don't expect 'success' from test helpers\n\nHelpers are about to raise exceptions for skip/fail events,\nrather than returning a value.\n",
    "Automated: 'return fail' --> assert\n\nPytest uses assertion rewriting to add context to normal `assert` statements.\nThis means a lot of `if` statements can be better written as assertions.\n",
    "Automated: Rewrite most skip/fail from tests\n\nRather than returning a string from tests, we can just call `pytest.skip()`\nor `pytest.fail()`. This throws an exception, which is transparently handled\nby the pytest runner and provides contextual information.\n",
    "Automated: Don't return 'success' from tests\n\nTests that exit without raising any exceptions are considered to\nhave passed.\n"
