# gdal-pytest

This is a couple of scripts I used in 2018 when refactoring GDAL's test suite to use Pytest.

This repo won't receive updates. It's here so I can talk about it at:

* [FOSS4G-SOTM Oceania 2019](https://2019.foss4g-oceania.org/schedule/2019-11-14?sessionId=JQLQ8P)
* [Pycon AU 2019](https://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/how-i-migrated-a-huge-oss-project-to-use-pytest)

Sorry it's not terribly well laid out or documented. It wasn't really intended for anyone but me.
